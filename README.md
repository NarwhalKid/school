 - a lot of stuff doesn't work as intended

## steam

### steam info
 - many games still wont work correctly because admin is completely required
 - you may need to give yourself a hotspot on data in order to play online

### getting steam
 - download the following:
  - [steam installer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/15eJnb1JOC7o8fTEwX0Bp1fWlx2gU0uJ9/view?usp=share_link)
  - [noadmin.bat](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WAmmjmAF-gHeVggQKARxvg-lPbWAknOc/view?usp=share_link)
 - find somewhere in the school where you have data (a vpn on school wifi won't work unfortunately) and start a hotspot on your phone and connect to it on your computer (or just do this at home)
 - open wherever you downloaded those files and drag the SteamSetup.exe file onto the noadmin.bat file
 - when it asks for the destination folder, make it "C:\Makeup Work\" or something
 - on the "steam error", click ignore
 - on the "steam service error", click cancel
 - it will take a decent while to open. just be patient
 - once it does, log into your account (obviously)
 - to download games make sure youre connected to a hotspot on data (or again, at home)
 - i highly recommend the following
  - Steam tab at top
  - Settings
  - Interface
  - Run Steam when my computer starts > off
  - Notify me about additions or changes to my games, new releases, and upcoming releases > off

### using steam after download
 - open file explorer
 - click "Windows (C:)" on the left
 - click whatever folder you made
 - scroll to "steam.exe" and open
 - go through the same steam error steps as before
 - wait for it to open (again, be patient, it could take a while
 - note that even after closing out of the steam window it will likely stay open (click the carrot icon towards the right of your windows taskbar to see steam and open the window if it's already been opened)
