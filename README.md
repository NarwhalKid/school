## steam

### steam info
 - many games still wont work correctly because admin is completely required
 - you may need to give yourself a hotspot on data in order to play online

### getting steam
 - download the following:
   - [steam installer](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KSBxzdQcd3LRzFaigYG-ANRrFuSc_cMx/view?usp=drive_link)
   - [noadmin.bat](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WAmmjmAF-gHeVggQKARxvg-lPbWAknOc/view?usp=share_link)
 - find somewhere in the school where you have data (a vpn on school wifi won't work unfortunately) and start a hotspot on your phone and connect to it on your computer (or just do this at home)
 - open wherever you downloaded those files and drag the SteamSetup.exe file onto the noadmin.bat file
 - when it asks for the destination folder, make it `C:\Makeup Work\` or something
 - on the "steam error", click ignore
 - on the "steam service error", click cancel
 - it will take a decent while to open. just be patient
 - once it does, log into your account (obviously)
 - to download games make sure youre connected to a hotspot on data (or again, at home)
 - you can now delete the steam installer and you can delete or move the noadmin bat (the noadmin bat does not work for everything, just some software that asks for admin that doesnt completely need it)
 - i highly recommend the following
   - Steam tab at top
   - Settings
   - Interface
   - Run Steam when my computer starts > off
   - Notify me about additions or changes to my games, new releases, and upcoming releases > off

### using steam after download
 - open file explorer
 - click "Windows (C:)" on the left
 - click whatever folder you made
 - scroll to "steam.exe" and open
 - go through the same steam error steps as before
 - wait for it to open (again, be patient, it could take a while
 - note that even after closing out of the steam window it will likely stay open (click the carrot icon towards the right of your windows taskbar to see steam and open the window if it's already been opened)

## getting minecraft java edition
 - NOTE: YOU WILL NEED TO DO THIS AT HOME
 - NOTE: YOU WILL NEED TO HAVE A MINECRAFT ACCOUNT
 - make sure youre at home and not on school wifi (trust me its important)
 - [download the portable minecraft bat](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_o0Wik1qjkvSay1DHDionB2x40JUpqgA/view?usp=drive_link)
 - open the minecraft.bat file
 - move the downloaded folder into wherever you want to keep it before you do the next steps (if you have a games folder on your computer move it there)
 - open the folder
 - open the minecraft folder
 - open "Minecraft.exe"
 - download the current minecraft version
 - everything should now work! if you move the folder things will reset.
 - just go back and open Minecraft.exe to play in the future. you do not need an active internet connection to play offline.

## playing fortnite
 - [download brave browser](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1y103_VbBivKIRq6lEZrKgHeDIz9A05-g/view?usp=drive_link)

 - activate developer mode on the top right
 - extract the xcloud keyboard extension zip
 - click "load unpacked" on the top left of the brave extensions page
 - select the xcloud keyboard extension folder
 - enable psiphon (set the servers to united states for the best results)
 - [open fortnite on xcloud](https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play/games/fortnite/BT5P2X999VH2)
 - sign in
 - start fortnite (ignore no controller message)
 - click the extensions icon on the top right of your browser (puzzle piece)
 - pin the extension
 - click the extension icon that you just pinned
 - click "edit"
 - add a random binding (i normally add equals to the A button)
 - select save
 - click anywhere on the page
 - you can now use your keyboard to control the page
 - click enter in the lobby
 - go to the settings tab
 - go to the controller settings tab
 - set your joystick deadzone to 5% on both
 - youre good to go! if the extension ever stops working just toggle the random binding in the extension settings

## websites
 - note: some of these may require [firefox](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OyuoQn3aPxvrOcomx2o5sIKXriLcAa72/view?usp=share_link) or to use chrome, click the profile icon, and click guest
 - [ultraviolet](https://54.167.87.46/)
   - as of writing this, you have to use firefox and do the following to use the page:
     - Advanced
     - scroll down
     - Accept the Risk and Continue (dw, its safe, i host it myself on AWS, i just didnt bother setting up a better ssl certificate so we're using a self signed one which makes the browser mad at us)
  - [narwhalkidgames](https://www.narwhalkid.com/games/)
  - [2048verse](https://2048verse.com/)
  - [libreddit (reddit)](https://github.com/libreddit/libreddit-instances/blob/master/instances.md)
    - unfortunately due to the api changes on reddit, there may be temporary issues with an instance and youll have to try another
  - [invidious (youtube)](https://api.invidious.io/)
  - [wikipedia speedruns](https://wikispeedruns.com/)
  - [tinf0il](https://gfcbnfhxrgn.tinf0il.tech/proxy.html)
  - [astroid](https://astroid.jib.ar/worksheets/index.html)

 ## bookmarklets
  - press ctrl+shift+b if your bookmarks bar is not currently visible
  - highlight the text and drag it to your bookmarks bar to add it as a bookmark. click the bookmark to activate the bookmarklet
  - phone controller
    - `javascript:{var s=document.createElement('script');s.id="ctrljs-js";if(!!!document.getElementById("ctrljs-js")){s.src='https://ctrljs-1.narwhalkid.repl.co/bookmarklet.js',document.body.appendChild(s);}else{document.getElementById("statusView").style.display = document.getElementById("statusView").style.display == "none" ? "" : "none"}};void(0);`
    - click to get a QR code to scan with your phone, click again to toggle the QR code on screen (will not work correctly on some sites or parts of sites)
  - firefox only libreddit changer
    - `javascript:document.location = (document.location + '').replace('www.reddit.com', 'reddit.invak.id')`
    - click the bookmarklet when you go to a reddit.com page and it doesnt work (feel free to change the libreddit instance url (reddit.invak.id to something else)
   
  ## staying quiet
   - you could bring in a usb to keep the files on (or just a straight up bootable OS)
   - keeping files in `C:\Makeup Work\` or something of the sort can help prevent files from being found from the taskbar windows search (of course if this ever leaks to the administrators then they could probably find it there so you may want to keep it somewhere else just because i said that but if you really dont care then that should be good enough)
   - keep apps unpinned from your taskbar
   - be ready to alt+tab away if you have to
   - if youre using steam, turn on the settings i mentioned at the end
   - basically just dont be stupid

## undoing everything
 - uninstalling programs
   - search "Add or remove programs" in the taskbar search bar and open it.
   - from there uninstall any programs you may have had like firefox or discord
 - removing files
   - simply open wherever you saved your files/games in file explorer and delete the individual files or the whole folder.
